## Example

The following Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) example obtains a  **[View](41c8d149-9912-1685-4c8b-3c849cc6f1ed.md)** object by using the **[CurrentView](177e6387-9ccb-cb71-bbe5-332c25485848.md)** property of the **[Explorer](026591e5-049f-503a-4166-34e6dbc225fb.md)** object, then sets the **[Filter](9a4b4b27-d543-df82-3058-e0a6ad2f51a1.md)** property of the **View** object to display only those Outlook items that were received last week.


```vb
Private Sub FilterViewToLastWeek() 
 
 Dim objView As View 
 
 
 
 ' Obtain a View object reference to the current view. 
 
 Set objView = Application.ActiveExplorer.CurrentView 
 
 
 
 ' Set a DASL filter string, using a DASL macro, to show 
 
 ' only those items that were received last week. 
 
 objView.Filter = "%lastweek(""urn:schemas:httpmail:datereceived"")%" 
 
 
 
 ' Save and apply the view. 
 
 objView.Save 
 
 objView.Apply 
 
End Sub
